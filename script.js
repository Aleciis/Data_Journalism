var park = document.getElementById()
// clicking on each individual svg will send you to a different sub-macro page showing an svg of the borough and every park within that borough
// using id in each svg (each id is a different zipcode), can be used as a query string for each sub-macro page
// is it possible to have a different page for each svg??
// first needs svg on click function
// then possibly needs jinja or getelementbyid
// then needs each svg of zip code individually
