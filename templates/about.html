	<h1>Data Journalism - About</h1>
    <h3>All Parks in NYC</h3>
    <p>New York City is known to have diverse communities, countless opportunities, and more importantly to this investigation, parks. I wanted to investigate how many parks there were in NYC because no matter where I went, there always seemed to be a park, whether it be big or small, lively or quiet.</p> 
    <p>It made me think "How common is it to stumble upon a park when you're simply walking?", and then made me begin this investigation.</p>
    <h3>Cleansing Data</h3>
    <p>Looking at the data in the CSV file, there was a lot of information that was not very useful to me, such as their jurisdiction area or if they are near a body of water. </p>
    <p>Given this, I cut all the data down to only it's most important sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Park Name</li>
        <li>Size (in acres)</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Borough</li>
        <li>Type of Park</li>
        <li>Zip Code</li>
        <li>Website Link to NYC Park website about each park</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that I had the most important data points for my journalism project, I used a python script to convert the CSV file into a JSON file containing nested dictionaries of all the park data, which makes the data a lot more understandable and easier to work with.</p>

    <a href="../Data_Journalism/data/Parks_Data.json">Here is the JSON file containing all the data, but easier to understand</a>
